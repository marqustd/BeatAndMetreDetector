[PyQt4 scrolling live data with MatplotlibWidget](2016-07-30_qt_matplotlib_sine_scroll) - pretty graphs with the MatPlotLib library (which many people already know how to use), but likely too slow for realtime / interactive graphing | <img src="/2016-07-30_qt_matplotlib_sine_scroll/demo.gif" width="300">
